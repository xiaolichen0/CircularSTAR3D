LocalSTAR3D: a local stack-based RNA 3D structural alignment tool

* Terms
LocalSTAR3D is free of charge for non-commercial purposes, and it comes
with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY.

Where appropriate, please cite the following LocalSTAR3D paper:
Chen et al. (2020). "LocalSTAR3D: a local stack-based RNA 3D structural alignment tool." 
Nucleic Acids Res., 48(13),e77-e77. (doi:10.1093/nar/gkaa453).

* Requirement
LocalSTAR3D is implemented by using java 1.8 and can be executed in 64-bit 
Linux. Two java packages, "commons-cli-1.2.jar" and "EJML-core-0.26.jar", 
are used in the program to support argument parsing and efficient 
matrix computation. "DSSR" is used for base pairing annotation. "RemovePseudoknots"
is used for pseudo-knots removal. "Apache ant" is required to compile the source code.

Apache ant: http://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi

For Linux system, ant can be installed directly by using command line.
Debian/Ubuntu: "apt-get install ant"
Fedora/CentOS: "yum install ant"

Notice: RemovePseudoknots in the "tool" directory is compiled with 
GNU libc 2.12 in Linux. (The version of libc can be checked with "ldd --version".) 
If RemovePseudoknots can not work (*.npk.ct files can not be generated), 
please update the GNU lib in Linux or recompile RNAstructure in your system. 
RNAstructure can be downloaded at "http://rna.urmc.rochester.edu/RNAstructure.html".

LocalSTAR3D uses DSSR for PDB annotation. There are two ways to use DSSR with LocalSTAR3D:
1. Download DSSR into tools/. After that, you will have LocalSTAR3D/tools/DSSR/x3dna-dssr.
2. If you don't have DSSR, you can copy the DSSR annotation for your PDB into LocalSTAR3D/STAR3D_struct_info/.
   For example, if you want to preprocess PDB 6d90, you can manually copy your 6d90.dssr file into LocalSTAR3D/STAR3D_struct_info/.
   The DSSR annotation files that were used to generate the results in our manuscript are provided along with LocalSTAR3D package.
   
* Installation
Go to the LocalSTAR3D home directory and execute "ant jar".
(The users can also clean the compiled files by executing "ant clean")

* Preprocessing
LocalSTAR3D downloads PDB files and preprocesses them to retrieve the 
secondary structural information.

Go to the LocalSTAR3D home directory and execute 
"java -cp LocalSTAR3D.jar Preprocess [PDB ID] [Chain ID]".

Notice: Make sure the folder "tools", "PDB", "STAR3D_struct_info" and file "LocalSTAR3D.jar" 
sin the same directory. 

* Structural Alignment
Go to the LocalSTAR3D home directory and execute 
"java -jar LocalSTAR3D.jar [PDB1 ID] [Chain1 ID] [PDB2 ID] [Chain2 ID]"
More options for the program can be seen by executing 
"java -jar LocalSTAR3D.jar -h"

* Examples
Kink-turn motifs:
java -cp LocalSTAR3D.jar Preprocess 4bw0 A
java -cp LocalSTAR3D.jar Preprocess 1s72 0
java -jar LocalSTAR3D.jar -d false -n 10 4bw0 A 1s72 0

Group II introns:
java -cp LocalSTAR3D.jar Preprocess 5g2x A
java -cp LocalSTAR3D.jar Preprocess 4r0d A	
java -jar LocalSTAR3D.jar 5g2x A 4r0d A

IRES:
java -cp LocalSTAR3D.jar Preprocess 4v5c AV
java -cp LocalSTAR3D.jar Preprocess 6d90 4
java -jar LocalSTAR3D.jar 4v5c AV 6d90 4
